          We invite the submission of papers for presentation at the ICLR {{
          page.year }} workshop. We broadly welcome submissions related to
          representational alignment among artificial and biological information
          processing systems. Submissions can come from any area of cognitive
          science, neuroscience, machine learning, or related fields. We welcome
          <strong>short</strong> (up to 5 pages + references and supplement) or
          <strong>long</strong> (up to 10 pages + references and supplement)
          technical and position papers.

        <h5>Submission instructions for papers</h5>

        <h6>Submission portal</h6>
        <p>
          All paper submissions should be made via
          <a
            href="{{ page.openreview }}"
            class="btn btn-custom btn-xs"
            target="_blank"
            >OpenReview</a
          >.
        </p>

        <h6 id="submission-format">Submission format</h6>
        <p>
          Authors must select between the
          <strong>short</strong> (up to 5 pages + references and supplement) or
          <strong>long</strong> (up to 10 pages + references and supplement)
          paper submission tracks. The supplement can include an author
          contributions statement, a disclosure on the use of automated tools
          (such as generative AI), and/or a technical appendix. Submissions will
          be evaluated within the track to which they are submitted.
        </p>

        <p>
          Paper submissions should consist of a single PDF that follows the
          official ICLR LaTeX template but with an edited header that identifies
          the submission as to the workshop rather than as to the main
          conference; for convenience, we have adapted the official ICLR
          conference template into a
          <a
            href="https://github.com/representational-alignment/iclr-workshop-template/raw/refs/heads/master/re-align{{ page.year }}.zip"
            class="btn btn-secondary btn-xs"
            target="_blank"
            >Re-Align template </a
          >.
        </p>

        <h6 id="anonymization">Anonymization</h6>
        <p>
          All paper submissions should be fully anonymized. Please remove any
          identifying information such as author names, affiliations,
          personalized GitHub links, etc. Links to anonymized content are
          acceptable, though we do not require reviewers to examine such
          content.
        </p>

        <h6 id="ai-disclosure">
          Disclosure of the use of artificial intelligence
        </h6>
        <p>
          In accordance with the
          <a
            href="https://blog.iclr.cc/2025/08/26/policies-on-large-language-model-usage-at-iclr-2026/"
            >policies on large language model usage at ICLR 2026</a
          >, any use of (generative) artificial intelligence to prepare the
          content of a paper submission must be disclosed. (This disclosure can
          be placed in the supplement.)
        </p>

        <h6>Interdisciplinarity</h6>
        <p>
          During submission, authors will be asked to specify if their
          submission aligns more with cognitive science, neuroscience, or
          machine learning; we will try to assign reviewers accordingly. Since
          this workshop is interdisciplinary with the goal to bring together and
          enable knowledge transfer between researchers from various
          communities, we suggest (but do not require) submissions to use the
          terminology and general formalism described in the
          <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13018">position paper</a>
          that the organizers of this workshop co-authored in collaboration with
          others. (Commentaries and critiques of this framework are also
          welcome!)
        </p>

        <h5>Policies on submission and review of papers</h5>

        <h6>Prohibition on prior publication</h6>
        <p>
          We welcome only papers that have not yet been accepted for publication
          at other venues. Submission of late-breaking results and unpublished
          or ongoing work and abstracts thereof, including works currently under
          review but not yet accepted at other venues, are welcome. For example,
          papers that are concurrently submitted to ICML {{ page.year }}, CogSci
          {{ page.year }}, and CCN {{ page.year }} are welcome. We also welcome
          accepted COSYNE {{ page.year }} abstracts, which should be extended to
          our short or long paper format. Papers that have already appeared at a
          venue for presentation (including any workshop, conference, or
          journal) must be significantly updated or extended to be eligible for
          submission to the workshop.
        </p>

        <h6>Policy on the use of artificial intelligence</h6>
        <p>
          Because the Re-Align Workshop is a participatory initiative,
          AI-generated papers are not allowed. AI assistance is permitted, but
          submissions must be primarily human-authored. Authors must also follow
          the
          <a
            href="https://blog.iclr.cc/2025/08/26/policies-on-large-language-model-usage-at-iclr-2026/"
            >policies on large language model usage at ICLR 2026</a
          >, including disclosing the nature of the use of AI and holding
          responsibility for all content of submitted work.
        </p>

        <h6>Reciprocal reviewer policy</h6>
        <p>
          At least one author from each submission must volunteer to serve as a
          reviewer for the Re-Align Workshop between the
          <a href="#dates">submission and reviewing deadlines</a>. It is
          sufficient to identify an author who has already accepted an
          invitation to be a reviewer for the workshop.
        </p>

        <h6>Selection criteria for papers</h6>
        <p>
          All paper submissions will be checked for adherence to the workshop
          submission policies; submissions not meeting
          <a href="#submission-format">formatting</a>,
          <a href="#anonymization">anonymity</a>, and
          <a href="#ai-disclosure">AI disclosure</a> requirements, as well as
          those deemed off-topic or not meeting minimum academic standards, will
          be desk-rejected by the orgnizers. Valid paper submissions will then
          undergo double-blind peer review by the workshop's
          <a href="#program-committee">program committee</a>, and editorial
          decisions will be made by the
          <a href="#organizers">organizing committee</a>. Accepted papers will
          be chosen based on theoretical or empirical validation, novelty, and
          suitability to the workshop's goals.
        </p>

        <h6>Non-archival policy for papers</h6>
        <p>
          The workshop is non-archival, <i>i.e.</i>, we expect that papers
          appearing at the workshop will be subsequently published at a journal
          or other venue with archival proceedings.
        </p>

        <h6>Presentation format for papers</h6>
        <p>
          All accepted papers will be invited for presentation at the ICLR {{
          page.year }} Re-Align Workshop in the form of a poster. A few select
          contributions will additionally be invited as contributed talks.
          Accepted papers will be posted in a non-archival format on the
          workshop website.
        </p>

        <p>
          Posters should be in portrait orientation with a maximum height of
          91cm (36") and a maximum width of 61cm (24").
        </p>

        <h6>Remote presentation for papers</h6>
        <p>
          Acceptance decisions on paper submissions will be considered
          independently from any constraints on the ability of authors to attend
          ICLR in person. Our goal is to allow every accepted paper to be
          presented in person. If our assigned space at the conference does not
          have the capacity for all papers to be presented as posters, we will
          feature any papers we cannot accommodate via presentation in an
          asynchronous virtual format to be determined. This option will also be
          available to presenters who are unable to travel due to visa or
          funding restrictions.
