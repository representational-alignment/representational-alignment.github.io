        ##### Funding for contributors to ICLR 2025
        This year, ICLR is discontinuing the separate "Tiny Papers" track, and 
        is instead requiring each workshop to accept short paper 
        submissions, with an eye toward inclusion; see the
        [ICLR page on Tiny Papers](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/CallForTinyPapers) 
        for more details. Authors of these papers will be earmarked for 
        potential funding from ICLR, but need to submit a separate application 
        for Financial Assistance that evaluates their eligibility. This 
        application for Financial Assistance to attend ICLR 2025 is available at
        [ICLR 2025 Financial Assistance](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2025/FinancialAssistance),
        and closes on March 2nd.

about: |
  Both natural and artificial intelligences form representations of the world that they use to reason, make decisions,
  and communicate. Despite extensive research across machine learning, neuroscience, and cognitive science, it
  remains unclear what the most appropriate ways are to compare and align the representations of intelligent systems
  ([Sucholutsky et al., 2023](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13018)). 
  In the second edition of the Workshop on Representational Alignment (Re-Align), we
  bring together researchers from diverse fields who study representational alignment to make concrete progress on
  this set of open interdisciplinary problems. We invite researchers across the machine learning, neuroscience, and
  cognitive science communities to participate in the workshop, and to contribute to the workshop in two ways:

  **First, in the form of [contributed papers](#cfp)** that
  address questions of representational alignment that stem from the following central theme: When and why 
  do intelligence systems learn aligned representations, and how can scientists and engineers intervene on this alignment? 
  Other questions topical for this yearâ€™s workshop include:
  - To what extent does representational alignment indicate shared computational strategies among biological and artificial systems?
  - How have current alignment metrics advanced our understanding of computation, and what measurement approaches should we explore next?
  - How can we develop more robust and generalizable measures of alignment that work across different domains and types of representations?
  - How can we systematically increase (or decrease) representational alignment among biological and artificial systems?
  - What are the implications (positive and negative) of increasing or decreasing representational alignment between systems, on behavioral alignment, value alignment, and beyond?

  **Second, by participating in our workshop [hackathon](#hackathon)**.
  Since the first iteration of Re-Align workshop, there have been numerous debates around the metrics that
  we use to measure representational similarity, which is often taken as a measure of representational alignment (e.g.,
  [Cloos et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07059); 
  [Khosla et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.06.20.599957); 
  [Lampinen et al., 2024](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05847); 
  [Schaeffer et al., 2024](https://openreview.net/forum?id=vbtj05J68r)). 
  As of now, there is little consensus on which metric best achieves the goal of identifying similarity
  between systems.
  The hackathon component of the workshop will be helpful in articulating the consequences of these methodologies
  by facilitating a common language among researchers, and as a result increase the reproducibility of research in this
  subdomain.
